\chapter{Proposed system}
\label{sec:proposed system}

\section{Overview}
A distributed system where a user is able to search and find movies. Information for the selected movie is displayed. He is able to add the found movie to his favourites list.

\section{Functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
	\item The following components shall be implemented
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
		\item A database
		\item A server exposing functions for retrieving data from the database
		\item A Windows Application
		\item A Web Client
	\end{itemize}
	\item All above parts shall be implemented in C\#. The Windows client in WPF, in .NET 4.5, and the web client in ASP.NET
	\item Communication between clients and server shall happen in a RESTful manner sending JSON over HTTP
	\item The server must build on the HttpListener for HTTP communication
	\item The server should support two ways of retrieving data. One being from its memory cache and the other being from the Database. If the requested data is in memory it will be retrieved from there instead of from the Database
	\item The server shall be able to merge information from My Movie API. If some data is not stored locally, but is in the My Movie API, it will get the data from there and send it to the client
\end{itemize}

\section{Nonfunctional requirements}

\vspace{0.2cm}
\item[\textbf{Reliability}]
\begin{itemize}
\item Reliability is a \textit{must} for the system. The user should experience as few software crashes as possible, with a maximum of 2 per day.

\section{System models}

\subsection{Scenarios}
In order to specify the use cases in which the user can interact with the program, it is required to initially specify a couple of different scenarios the user can have while utilizing the application.

The following scenarios were set up in order to analyze them:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ | l | p{10cm} |  }
		 \hline
		Scenario name & \underline{find movie}  \\ \hline
		Participating Actors & \underline{John} \\ \hline
		Flow of Events & \begin{enumerate}
						\item John wants to find out the name of the actor playing the protagonist in Pulp Fiction. He enter the title in the search field.

						\end{enumerate}
						\\ \hline
						
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ | l | p{10cm} |  }

\subsection{Use case model}



\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
	\item User
	\item Administrator
	\item Server
\end{itemize}

Through the inspection of the scenarios depicted in the Scenarioâ€™s section, we have deduced the use cases that the program should be able to support.

The use cases are as follows:

User use cases:
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
	\item Find movie
	\item Find actor
	\item Make account
	\item Add to favourites list
	\item Remove from favourites list
	\item View favourites list
	\item Log in to account
	\item Log out from account
\end{itemize}

Administrator use cases:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Add movie
	\item Edit movie information
	\item Delete movie
	\item Add actor
	\item Edit actor information
	\item Delete actor
\end{itemize}

After refining the system design, we have added the following boundary scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
	
	\item StartWebServer
	\item ShutdownWebServer
	\item ConfigureWebServer
	\item ConnectionLostException
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

\subsection{Object model}

\subsubsection{Entity objects}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[1.] Movie \hfill \\
	A movie is a collection of data about a specific movie. It has attributes defining its title, length, year of production and genre. Some movies are episodes of series and has attributes defining it's season and episode number.
	
	\item[2.] Person \hfill \\
	The person entity defines data about a specific person. Each entity instance includes attributes defining the name and the gender of the person. The person links to zero or more person information, describing further information such as age.
	
	\item[3.] User \hfill \\
	The user entity defines data about each specific user. Each entity instances includes attributes defining the log in informtion of the user. Each user has a list of favourite movies.
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Boundary objects}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Client \hfill \\
	The general object for the actual client that is being used. This boundary object can represent both the Web Client and the Desktop Client

	\item SearchField \hfill \\
	The main search field where you can search for searchable content like movies and actors.
	
	\item SearchResults \hfill \\
	The object defining the form that is presented when the user has receive a list of resulsts from a search. The object is used when the user interacts with the result list.
	
	\item RegisterForm \hfill \\
	The user can enter a desired username and password to create his account.

	\item LogInForm \hfill \\
	A username and password field where the user can input his login information.
	
	\item LogOutButton \hfill \\
	The user can press this button to log out of his account
	
	\item FavouritesList \hfill \\
	The list containing all the users favourite movies. The user can remove movie from the list
	
	\item FavouriteButton \hfill \\
	A button on every movie to add the movie to the users favourites list
	
	\item MovieInformationForm \hfill \\
	A form where an Administrator can input data about a movie
	
	\item ActorInformationForm \hfill \\
	A form where an Administrator can input data about an Actor
	
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Control objects}

These controllers are all more or less self-explanatory. They enable the user to realise all use cases from their client.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[1.] FindMovieController
	\item[2.] FindActorController
	\item[3.] MakeAccountController 
	\item[4.] AddToFavouritesListController
	\item[5.] RemoveFromFavouritesListController
	\item[6.] ViewFavouritesListController
	\item[7.] LogInToAccountController
	\item[8.] LogOutFromAccountController 
	
	\item[9.] AddMovieController
 	\item[10.] EditMovieController
 	\item[11.] DeleteMovieController
 	\item[12.] AddActorController
 	\item[13.] EditActorController
 	\item[14.] DeleteActorController
 	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Dynamic model}

\subsubsection{Sequence diagrams}

The sequence diagrams explains some of the more apparant use cases of the system in detail. The interactions shown in the diagrams are not directly linked to the final interaction of the actual program, but is describing the overall flow of the messages sent between the objects being used.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{State machines}
An entity can have different states. As seen in figure \ref{fig:Entity State Machine Diagram}, after its creation (POST), it is stores in the persistent database module on the server. From here it can either be deleted (DELETE), or it can be fetched (GET). When a object is queried from the database the server will fetch it as a DTO (Data transfer object) into the servers memory. Often used objects will be saved in the server's cache. The DTO is then sent to the client requesting the object. The client-side also have a cache. This means that if the user has recently queried the object, it will not be fetched from the server, but from the local cache. A DTO can from there either be updated (PUT) and pushed back to the server, or cache time-out and be deleted (This means that only the DTO will be deleted and not the entity in the database).

This is valid for Movies and Actors. Users is not implementing these states as users should not be cached, and only have one state, which is In Database.
