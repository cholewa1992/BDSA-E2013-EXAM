\subsection{Purpose of the system}

The purpose of the system is to create a tool for people watching movies. We want to give our users access to a movie database available at their fingertips for inspiration and the possibility to read about their favourite movies.

Two clients shall be available . A browser based client enabling access from a browser, as well as a desktop application for their personal computer.  

The system should allow users to easily search for actors and movies, and read information about them, as well as see the links between actors and movies.


%Init formulation The purpose of the system is to create a tool for easy access to a movie database through the use of two clients: A desktop- and browser-version.


\subsection{Scope of the system}

The scope of the system is as follows

Scope is making a system containing most movies with related information, and making this data available though a distributed RESTful web service. Two clients will also be implemented: An ASP.net web browser client, and a desktop application done with WPF.

Part of the scope will also be to work with responsiveness enabling caching and database optimizing through indexing and optimized SQL quires.

Out of scope is looking into user security issues

%Init definition
%\begin{itemize}
%\item A Database which contains most movies related information
%\item An Application Server which exposes services making the Database %information accessible
%\item A Desktop Client which presents the user with movie information from the %Database
%\item A Web Client which also presents the user with movie information from the %Database
%\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Objectives and success criteria of the project}

The success criteria for this project is reached if end-users, in an easy and fast manner, are able to find movie information through both the desktop- and web-client. When information is received the user shall be able to edit the information and store the it in the database. The user shall also have access to a desktop application of the program. Success will be measured by how many users, without complications, are able to use our system to find desired information.

This goal is achieved if 9/10 users are able to do so.
