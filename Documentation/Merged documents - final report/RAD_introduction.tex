\subsection{Purpose of the system}

The purpose of the system is to create a tool for people who watch movies. We want to give our users access to a movie database available at their fingertips for inspiration and the possibility to read about their favourite movies. The focus is on a ShareWare idea, where users are free to edit the content of the database.

Two clients shall be available. A browser based client enabling access from a browser, as well as a desktop application for their personal computer.  

The system should allow users to easily search for actors and movies, and read information about them, as well as see the links between actors and movies.


%Init formulation The purpose of the system is to create a tool for easy access to a movie database through the use of two clients: A desktop- and browser-version.


\subsection{Scope of the system}

The scope is to make a system which contains most movies with related information, and making this data available though a distributed RESTful web service. Two clients will be implemented: An ASP.net web browser client, and a desktop application done with WPF.

Part of the scope will furthermore be to work with responsiveness and optimization in general, enabling database optimizing through indexing and optimized SQL quires.

%Part of the scope will furthermore be to work with responsiveness enabling caching and database optimizing through indexing and optimized SQL quires.

Out of scope is looking into user security issues and favourite lists.

%Init definition
%\begin{itemize}
%\item A Database which contains most movies related information
%\item An Application Server which exposes services making the Database %information accessible
%\item A Desktop Client which presents the user with movie information from the %Database
%\item A Web Client which also presents the user with movie information from the %Database
%\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Objectives and success criteria of the project}

The success criteria for this project is reached if end-users, in an easy and fast manner, are able to find movie information through both the desktop- and web-client. When information is received the user shall be able to edit some information and store the it in the database. Success will be measured by how many users, without complications, are able to use our system to find desired information.

This goal is achieved if 9/10 users are able to do so within 5 minutes.
