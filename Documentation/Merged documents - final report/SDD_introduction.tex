\subsection{Purpose of the system}
%This has been copy-pasted from the RAD. Maybe it should be changed at some point? Maybe not.
The purpose of the system is to create a tool for people watching movies. We want to give our users access to a movie database available at their fingertips for inspiration and the possibility to read about their favourite movies.

Two clients shall be available . A browser based client enabling access from mobile devices as well as a desktop application for their personal computer.  


%Init formulation The purpose of the system is to create a tool for easy access to a movie database through the use of two clients: A desktop- and browser-version.


\subsection{Design goals}

\textbf{Performance}
\vspace{-1.1cm}
\begin{center}

\end{center}


\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Response Time} The clients must not exceed a maximum of 5 seconds response delay at user-input
\item \textbf{Memory} 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Desktop Client:} Maximum of 300mb RAM usage and 200mb installation space on the harddrive
\item \emph{Web Client:} Maximum of 300mc RAM usage
\item \emph{Server \& Database} Maximum of 4gb of RAM usage and 10gb space on the harddrive
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dependability Criteria}
\vspace{-1.1cm}
\begin{center}
\line(1,0){420}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Robustness} The system must not crash by any user-input
\item \textbf{Reliability} The system must behave according to the use cases and requirements defined in the Requirements Analysis Document
\item \textbf{Availability} The system must be available 98 \% of the time
\item \textbf{Fault Tolerance} If a fault occurs, the system must rather crash than be tolerate
\end{itemize}



\textbf{Cost Criteria}
\vspace{-1.1cm}
\begin{center}
\line(1,0){420}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Development Cost}  500,000.00 \$ for the initial development
\item \textbf{Deployment Cost}  50,000.00 \$ to deploy Server \& Database on mainframe
\item \textbf{Maintenance Cost}  100,000.00 \$ the first year following release, then 25,000.00 \$ every year to come
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Maintenance Criteria}
\vspace{-1.1cm}
\begin{center}
\line(1,0){420}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Modifiability} Any function must be changeable for a single programmer within 5 days
\item \textbf{Readability} An experienced programmer must be able to understand the code within 2 day
\item \textbf{Traceability of requirements} An experienced programmer must be able to map code to individual requirements within 2 days
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Design Criterion}
\vspace{-1.1cm}
\begin{center}
\line(1,0){420}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Utility} A user able to search and find a movie on IMDB.com within 5 minutes, must able be able to find a movie on this system within 5 minutes
\item \textbf{Usability} An inexperienced computer user must be able to search and find a movie within 15 minutes
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Trade-Off}
\vspace{-1.1cm}
\begin{center}
\line(1,0){420}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Delivery time vs Functionality} If delivery time can't be met, omitting the favourites list functionality and user login is allowed
\item\textbf{Delivery time vs Quality} If desired quality is not reached before deadline, quality requirements are pushed to the maintenance phase
\item\textbf{Delivery time vs Staffing} There are no options for extra staffing or expanding budget
\end{itemize}
