\chapter{Introduction}

This report documents the development of a software, allowing a user to access and edit information from the internet movie database (imdb).
The report contains a RAD, an SDD, a test description and a scrum documentation.
The RAD describes the agreement being conducted between development team and stake holder, going into details the specifications of the software under development.
The SDD specifies the choices that has been done before and during the process of developing the software.
The test description is a concise description of the strategy being used to ensure the quality of the software.
Finally, the scrum documentation depicts the working process of the development team, and how each task was carefully planned and conducting after a mutual agreement between the individual members of the team.
In entirety the report thoroughly describes the process each step taken in the designing, developing and finishing of the complete software.
