	When developing the program there was no predefined practice as to how to test the individual pieces of software produced. The individual developer was in charge of their own code, determining whether to use test-driven development or code first.
	To maintain a high quality for the software being comitted during the process of making the program, each developer was tasked to perform tests that thoroughly inspected each possible outcome of their methods in each individual class.
	There were no further rules about the structure of these tests, meaning that the individual developer themselves chose whether or not to utilize the array of testing methodologies \footnote{equivalence, boundary, state-base, path and polymorphism testing} during the testing phase
