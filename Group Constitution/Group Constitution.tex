\chapter{Group Constitution}

\section{Purpose}
The primary purpose of this constitution is to describe, how we are going to arrange our teamwork for the first year project.

\section{Group meetings}
Group meetings will be scheduled together, and it is expected that members meet as the decided times.

If a member can see he will be late, he will notify so in the Facebook group. If he has no access to Facebook at the time, he will call or send a textmessage to another member who will be meeting

\section{Decisions}
When scrum is not ongoing, decisions are made during group meetings. We will discuss and reach a consensus on decisions before implementing them. Important decisions will be documented and be uploaded on the group google drive (ref File Sharing). In the event of a conflict we will solve this as of our decided conflict handling


When Scrum is ongoing, we will use the Scrum methodology for decision making.


\section{File sharing}
We will use GIThub for file sharing
